/*
 * Question 1
 * 
 * 1) Take a look at the code sample. Predict 
 * the results, what do you think will appear 
 * in the console when you run the code snippet? 
 * 
 * 2) Run the code and compare your predictions 
 *    with the results. If the results were 
 *    different from what you predicted look 
 *    closely at the code and reconcile what 
 *    made the difference. 
 * 
 * 3) Your job is to write a function that 
 *    returns a random letter from a given 
 *    string. 
 * 
 * 4) Functions that produce random results are 
 *    difficult to test. Write a for loop that 
 *    calls the function 100 times and displays 
 *    the results. Run your code and check that 
 *    all the letters appear in the output. 
 * 
 * Stretch Challenge: Write a function that examines 
 * the results to check that all letters appear at 
 * least once.

// Question 1

var letters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";

console.log("The first letter is: "+letters[0]);
console.log("The last letter is: "+letters[letters.length - 1]);
